# x = 10              # integer 
# y = 10.2            # float
# z = "Hello"         # String

# when integer is mutiplied with float it convert to float or in addition
# x=x*y
# print(type(x))

# # Implicit type conversion
# x = x+y
# print(x , "type of x is :", type(x))

# explicit type conversion
# age = input("what is your age? ")
# #age=int(age)

# print(age, type(int(age)))
# this take input as string but we need number so we convert into int
# int type also give error for point input that is float we can convert this type into float

#NAME
name = input("what is your name? ")

print(name, type(str(name)))

#here we take input as string so we convert into string
